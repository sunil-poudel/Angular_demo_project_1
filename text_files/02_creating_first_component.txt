âœ… Step 2: Create Your First Component
  Letâ€™s create a new component where weâ€™ll build the weather UI.

ðŸ§± Whatâ€™s a Component?
  Think of a component like a small part of your page.
  Weâ€™ll make one called weather.

ðŸ›  How to Create It in WebStorm
  Open the Terminal in WebStorm (bottom tab).
  Run this command:

  ng generate component weather

    âœ… This will:

    Create a new folder src/app/weather

    Add 4 files: .ts, .html, .css, .spec.ts

    Automatically register it in your app

âœ¨ Show It on the Page
  Now, open src/app/app.component.html and replace everything with:

    <h1>ðŸŒ¤ Weather App</h1>
    <app-weather></app-weather>
    That <app-weather> is the selector of your new component. It shows the weather component inside the main app.

âœ… Done?

You should now see:

Copy
Edit
ðŸŒ¤ Weather App
weather works!
